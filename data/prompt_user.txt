Here is the code snippet for inspiration:
```

The contents of your prompt should be relevant to the snippet, but should not copy its details.

Here are the requirements of the prompt you will create:
1. The prompt should contain {num_words} words
2. Ensure the prompt is self-contained and reasonable.
3. Users are not assumed to know the given "code snippet". So when creating the prompt, don't mention "the snippet", "the given code", "the provided code", etc.!!

Please reply with only the created prompt, without any further explanations. Enclose it in triple quotes (""").
